 sunsetdusk.1.desc:0 "It was a bright day. Thousands of people tuned in to watch Nico, the current owner of the Sunset Discord, give a speech. It was one which was hotly anticipated, although its topic was not revealed to the public yet.\n\nHe wore a black suit and a grim expression.\n\n\"Friends, citizens. I am here to announce sorrow news. Despite us being currently at what I believe is the height of Sunset. Despite this, I am struggling to manage this server. Personal issues are blocking my ability to govern effectively, and I have debated this topic extensively with my staff\"."

 sunsetdusk.3.desc:0 "Nico has announced his resignation to the world, believing he is no longer fit to be leader. However, a huge debate followed on who shall follow him as owner.\n\nFew didn't expect the Head Admin to become the official successor to Nico. Sharing a similar ideology towards governance, as well as being popular, he was an obvious choice. He promises to keep the democracy and liberal reforms of Nico, but many anticipate that he will use his power and alliances to manipulate the server into his personal dictatorship.\n\nAll throughout Sunset, horns are blaring and crowds are cheering as the new successor tours the country, rallying the people to his side."

 sunsetdusk.4.desc:0 "Nico has announced his resignation to the world, believing he is no longer fit to be leader. However, a huge debate followed on who shall follow him as owner.\n\nA former owner, and the most active member of the server, it was not unlikely for him to be chosen. Many are opposed to his rule, but it is undeniable that he will contribute immensely. Being a harsh administrator, he wants to reform the server into a strict one party state, however with many liberal ideas to allow for feedback from the people.\n\nAll throughout Sunset, horns are blaring and crowds are cheering as the new successor tours the country, rallying the people to his side."

 sunsetdusk.5.desc:0 "Nico has announced his resignation to the world, believing he is no longer fit to be leader. However, a huge debate followed on who shall follow him as owner.\n\nAdartho was a choice that needed to be heavily justified to some. While not the most qualified of the staff team, his popularity and lack of controversy made him a good candidate to keep things the same way. Despite this, many people are fearful of the future, and a lot of people are uncertain that this former dissident will be able to lead a large staff team and reduce democracy like he promises.\n\nAll throughout Sunset, horns are blaring and crowds are cheering as the new successor tours the country, rallying the people to his side."

However, a huge debate followed on who shall follow him as owner.\n\nOcros is a candidate nobody thought would ever get the green light. While he does have a lot of loyalties in the military, he is a very controversial figure with controversial ideas, and constant protests for demotion. Yet, this act has cemented his position as an unpopular candidate. All through Sunset, people cry out for this act to be reversed."

 sunsetdusk.7.desc:0 "\"TBD\" were the letters scribbled down on Nico's resignal document. In a speech given by him to the crowd, he explained that the Staff should choose from among themselves, and that he should have no role.\n\nThe people did not respond well. Already, violent acts of terrorism and protest have swallowed the nation, and the staff are engaged in violent infighting. During this, a group known as the Sunsetian Helvania Movement, or SHM, under their leader WESTZ, have gained much popularity through their protests."

 SCW.9.desc:0 "One of the bloodiest wars of the existence of Sunset has ended, and as the dust settles, many are uncertain for the future.\n\nThe partisan group known as the Sunsetian Helvania Movement is no more, and has become the governmnet.

Despite this, factionalism has not ended, as Hasona's supporters range from people who want a benelovant oligarchy to those who want a harsh dictatorship.

As the first Majestan Brigades meet the first Sunsetian Militias, it has been made clear that the Sunsetians will not rest until Continuation Chat is back in their hands, and Majestaz destroyed. Meanwhile, Majestaz has allied himself with Partisans inside Sunset to \"liberate Sunsetia once and for all\" and \"put its rule in the right hands\".\n\n\Many shudder to think what this could mean for both nations."
